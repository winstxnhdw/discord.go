# discord.go

Existing Discord API wrappers do not have support for Discord self-bots. This is because self-bots are against Discord's Terms of Service. However, self-bots are still useful for automating tasks that would otherwise be tedious to do manually. This library aims to provide a simple, easy-to-use interface for interacting with the Discord API.

## Installation
